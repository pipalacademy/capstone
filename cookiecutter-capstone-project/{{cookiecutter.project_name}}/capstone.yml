    title: Clone Git repository with starter code
    description: |
      Get started by cloning the Git repository. This will have the starter code you will build upon.
      Your progress will get updated when you push to this repository.

      ```
      git clone {git_url}
      ```

      **Note:** You will have to start the project first to see your unique Git URL. Otherwise,
      you will only see `git_url` within curly braces.
    checks: []
is_published: false  # change this when you want to publish
